      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've contributed to over 20 successful releases and tested around 250 features across networking and web-based products - from when I started working up to May 19, 2025.
        These include a wide range of networking, security, and UI features.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in both manual and automated testing, combining detailed bug reporting, robust test script development, and close collaboration with development teams to ensure smooth, stable, and user-friendly releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always learning, always improving, and always aiming to test smarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I don't rely on specific tools - I'm quick to adapt and learn new technologies as needed.</b>
      </p>
    </div>
